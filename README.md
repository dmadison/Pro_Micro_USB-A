Pro Micro w/ USB-A
=========

![Pro Micro w/ USB-A](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ProMicro-USB-A_Product-Image.jpg)

The Pro Micro is a micro controller with an ATMega32U4 IC on board.
The USB transceiver is inside the 32U4, adding USB connectivity on-board without external USB interfaces. 
This comes in both a 3.3V and 5V version. 

This repository was forked from [the original SparkFun Pro Micro repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/Pro_Micro). The board has been modified to use [a USB-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#Connectors) connector.
